### Description:

“One day, I’m gonna open a restaurant, and everything on the menu is gonna be special. So, when somebody comes in and says, ‘Hey, Kelso, what’s special on the menu?’ I can say ‘Everything.'” — Kelso, That 70s show.

Whether you love Kelso, the 70s, or just want something special, Groovy blocks was a good place to land.  I made it because I love making things that are fun, special, and that look good.  It was fun for me to introduce elements of the 70s in homeage to a time that was known for it's unique designs, colors and fonts.  The project itself is special because I got to practice the Canvas API, something I have long been wanting to do.  And as far as looking good, well... see for yourself.

### This project demonstrates

🆕 Use of Canvas API

🆕 use of basic JavaScript principles like loops and conditionals to create a randomized, regenerating pattern.
